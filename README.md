New York City is arguably the taxi capital of America and home of the classic yellow taxicab. I am interested to work on yellow-taxi (medallion) demand prediction. They are the only vehicles that have the right to pick up street-hailing and prearranged passengers anywhere in New York City. Taxicabs are operated by private cab companies and licensed by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). They lease it to their drivers who in turn get to keep 100% of the fares and tips (some companies charge less for the lease, but retain a portion of the fares). These fares are set by the TLC, and the amount that a cab company can lease the vehicle to the driver is also set. Ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft have disrupted the taxi industry. Uber has become hugely popular in New York, and its trips outpaced yellow taxis for the first time last year. The biggest problem with taxis is they are not easy to find. Riders might have to wait longer when demand exceeds supply. There are Currently there are about 13,500 medallion cabs in NYC. They may not fulfill all the demand but it is possible to improve their utilization.

The model can make real-time demand predictions. It can be deployed inside the cars. Drivers could go to a location where there is higher demand in the next hour. As drivers get more revenue, they will be less likely to move to Uber/Lyft. Taxi cab companies could maintain their lease revenue for long period of time. If companies retain portion of the fares, they can work with the drivers to make a plan on how to deploy their taxis throughout the day to maximize profit.
